Here is the next stage of the interview. After successful completion of this stage, you will be invited to a phone screen to talk more about your background and you'll have the opportunity to learn more about the company and myself.

A successful candidate for the back-end engineering intern role will demonstrate:

1) Problem-solving, critical thinking ability and the ability to learn and ship code quickly. 
2) An ability to confidently work with numbers and mathematical concepts 
3) A clear understanding of certain computer-science and web fundamentals (REST, Databases, simple data structures)

Please complete the following questions. Use repl.it or another online environment to write your code 
and share a link below each question.

1. Imagine you're rolling two dice.

Dice 1 has x sides where each side has labels 1,2... x 
Dice 2 has y sides where each side has labels 1,2... y

When you roll both the dice and add the numbers you get a sum.

The target sum we're interested in is 12

The number of ways to get the sum 12 depends on the values of x and y.

For example, if Dice 1 has 7 sides (x = 7) and Dice 2 has 20 sides (y=20) 
then there are 7 ways to get the sum 12:

1 + 11 = 12 
2 + 10 = 12 
3 + 9 = 12 
4 + 8 = 12 
5 + 7 = 12 
6 + 6 = 12 
7 + 5 = 12

Write a program that will ask the user for the number of sides on dice 1 (x) and the number of sides on dice 2 (y) 
and will output the number of ways the dice can be rolled to get the sum 12

Please take some time to also consider and think about edge cases.

2. Write a program that defines the following equations:

a) Present Value of Annuity Due: https://financeformulas.net/Present_Value_of_Annuity_Due.html 
b) Future Value of Annuity Due: https://financeformulas.net/Future-Value-of-Annuity-Due.html 
c) Annuity Due Payment: https://financeformulas.net/Annuity-Due-Payment-from-Present-Value.html

After creating these equations, ask the user which equation they would like to use and allow them 
to type "a", "b" or "c".

After the user types this and presses enter, prompt them for the corresponding inputs needed to solve the equation and output the calculated answer.

3. Write a script that is able to scrape the results from the following URL: https://www.wealthprofessional.ca/special-reports/top-50/top-50-advisors-2018/253632

It should produce an organized sheet with labelled columns that details:

Rank, Company Name, Organization Name, Location, General Description.

Note that you also need to click on the link for each advisor to get to a 2nd page that details some of the above columns.
