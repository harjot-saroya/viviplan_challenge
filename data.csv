Jamie Suprun*50*HollisWealth, Industrial Alliance Securities*Simcoe, ON*Suprun Wealth Management*When asked what frustrates him most about being a financial advisor in Canada, Jamie Suprun is direct and to the point. \u201cCompliance, regulation, and competition from the banks,\u201d he says. \u201cClients are completely unaware of the time constraints that regulation and compliance put on us as financial advisors. Most of my mornings are spent dotting i\u2019s and crossing t\u2019s. It\u2019s too bad that a few bad eggs in the system have ruined the batch for the good advisors out there.\u201d
Douglas Griffioen*49*HollisWealth, Industrial Alliance Securities*Waterloo, ON*Wisdom Private Wealth*The past year has been one of change for Douglas Griffioen as his Wisdom Private Wealth team was assimilated into the Industrial Alliance family as part of its takeover of HollisWealth.

Now in his 16th year as an advisor, Griffioen identifies time management as his major challenge.\xa0

It\u2019s a healthy number, but one he wants to increase in the year ahead. To facilitate that, he plans to add more members to his team at B &amp; A Financial Group. Those clients will likely be assigned to fee-based accounts, he says, in tune with the direction the advisory business is turning. Recognized as one of the top performers at HollisWealth in 2017, Boland also plans to further integrate smart technology into the client experience to enhance the capabilities of B &amp; A Financial Group.<

Greg Milley*41*HollisWealth, Industrial Alliance Securities*Oakville, ON*The Milley Team*The past year has been a productive one for Oakville-based advisor Greg Milley, and he expects more of the same for 2018. Having added $6 million to his personal book in 2017, he is thinking expansion for The Milley Team. \u201cOur team is now seven people, and I have in place a succession plan for a senior advisor that should add another $20 million to the book,\u201d Milley says. \u201cOne of the seven is himself a new advisor, and we will be increasing client support directly to him.

Brian Lonsdale*39*CIBC Wood Gundy*Ottawa, ON*Lonsdale Financial Group*Among financial advisors in Canada, fee-based versus commission has been an ongoing debate for years. There are strong arguments for both compensation models, but Brian Lonsdale believes the future of the business lies in a fee-based system. Currently his practice is split 50/50, but he intends to move to a more transparent fee-based model in the years ahead. Lonsdale added $17 million to his book in 2017; with a current AUM of $136 million, his firm is well positioned to grow as the industry evolves.

Aj Chase*36*ScotiaMcLeod*Hamilton, ON*AJ Chase Financial Group*In the wealth management industry, less can be more, especially when it comes to clients. Overextending oneself can lead to decreased service, something AJ Chase and his team have taken steps to avoid. \u201cOur primary goal is to continue to comply with CRM2 regulation by being transparent with fees and returns,\u201d Chase says, \u201cand by reducing our client base to provide a higher level of service \u2013 revenue increased by 15.6% by reducing households.\u201d
Kevin Haakensen*35*HollisWealth, Industrial Alliance Securities*Saskatoon, SK*PWM Private Wealth Counsel*Alongside fellow Top 50 Advisor Kevin Hegedus, Kevin Haakensen has built PWM Private Wealth Counsel in one of the top advisory firms in the Prairies. That has entailed lots of hard work, but Haakensen says it\u2019s also been a hugely enjoyable journey. \u201cAs I reflect back on the last 20 years of my career, I have several emotions,\u201d he says. \u201cThe two largest are a huge sense of satisfaction and pride for the amount of people who have been helped through our practice in the last several decades, and also the number of fantastic employees that I have known and helped reach some of their goals of financial security.\u201d
Francis Sabourin*34*Richardson GMP*Montreal, QC*Sabourin Deraspe Wealth Management*Having an advisor with knowledge of international markets can be a real advantage for investors, and Francis Sabourin has developed a pristine reputation as an advisor with his finger on the pulse of investment opportunities not only in Canada, but worldwide.

Sean Harrell*33*Quadrus Investment Services*Winnipeg, MB*Howe, Harrell & Associates*Next year, Winnipeg-based advisor Sean Harrell will mark his 20th anniversary as a financial advisor, but his long tenure in wealth management hasn\u2019t diluted his passion for the job. \u201cAt 41, I still have a few more years to go,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s OK with me \u2013 I don\u2019t wake up dreading going to work. It\u2019s quite the opposite; after a few days off from work, I\u2019m ready to get back to it.\u201d
Brad Jardine*32*Aligned Capital Partners*Ancaster, ON*CIC Financial Group*Marking his 32nd year in the advisory businessin 2018, Brad Jardine returns to the Top 50 Advisors list for the third year in a row.

Luke Kratz*30*CIBC Wood Gundy*Victoria, BC*CIBC Private Wealth*This year marks Luke Kratz\u2019s fourth consecutive appearance on the Top 50 Advisors list, and it\u2019s an achievement he puts a lot of stock \xa0in. \u201cI have been fortunate to have been selected by <em>WPC</em> as a Top 50 Advisor in each of the previous three years,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is an incredible feat for any advisor, but for me, I have been fortunate to continually grow my business \u2013 assets, recurring revenue and recurring revenue per client \u2013 while shrinking the number of clients that I serve.\u201d Over the past year, Kratz has disengaged unprofitable clients in order to concentrate on those that will drive business in 2018, bringing his current client count to 174.

Kate Brown*28*RBC Dominion Securities*London, ON*Brown Wealth Management Group*The greatest transfer of wealth in Canada\u2019s history will take place over the next two decades, which means forward-thinking advisors like Kate Brown are already adding millennial clients. \u201cOver the past year, I have been asked by five of my clients to connect with their millennial-aged children to help them get started on the right financial path,\u201d Brown says. Looking to 2018, she has targeted 15% growth in both AUM and net revenue over the coming year.
Rona Birenbaum*27*Queensbury Strategies*Toronto, ON*Caring for Clients*It\u2019s been a year to remember for Rona Birenbaum.

Gerald L.*24*Ke*Kelowna, BC*Goertsen, De Thomas Wealth Management*to guide such matters. For Gerald Goertsen, retirement planning can be a highly complex and intricate part of the job, but also an area where he can really add value. \u201cI love helping families achieve their goals,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the proudest moment is when I am able to tell a client who was worried about retirement that they need to spend more money.\u201d
William Vastis*23*RBC Dominion Securities*Toronto, ON*The William Vastis Wealth Management Group*A 21-year veteran of the business, William Vastis has managed wealth for many different clients during his career, but one case in particular sticks out in his mind. \u201cI was assisting a family facing tremendous nepotism within stakeholders,\u201d he says, \u201cand it was looking like a breakdown in business and relationships.\u201d It\u2019s a scenario familiar to anyone who deals in estate planning, but in this case, Vastis\u2019 guidance averted a familial breakdown. \u201cI was able to help mitigate the relationships before it got out of hand and avoid lawsuits and divorces,\u201d he says. \u201cThe business is currently transitioning to the third generation, which is quite exciting.\u201d
David Christianson*22*National Bank Financial*Winnipeg, MB*Christianson Wealth Advisors*A 35-year veteran of the advisory business, David Christianson has been a constant presence on WPC\u2019s Top 50 Advisors list. The reason for that Christianson\u2019s consistency, both in growing his assets under management and in his ability to retain and attract new clients.
Paula Ives*21*RBC Dominion Securities*Edmonton, AB*Ives Wealth Management*Wealth management is often criticized for being far too maledominated, and the fact that the proportion of female wealth in Canada is set to rise substantially over the next decade has only served to highlight the issue. The industry needs more advisors of the calibre of Paula Ives, who added $32 million to her AUM in 2017 and plans to add another $50 million this year. In addition, Ives participates in WAMCAN, a financial literacy initiative with the City of Edmonton that helps women improve financial literacy and money management.

But rather than resting on his laurels, Barnsdale already has his targets for 2018 firmly in sight: He aims to complete the AFDS course to become a Chartered Financial Divorce Specialist [CFDS], which should prove useful in the pursuit of his other goal to increase his personal AUM by 20%. \xa0Outside of the office, Barnsdale\u2019s main ambition will be taking part in the Ride to Conquer Cancer charity event for the fifth consecutive year.
Alexandra Horwood*19*Richardson GMP*Toronto, ON*Alexandra Horwood & Partners*One of Wealth Professional Canada\u2019s 2017 Women of Influence, Alexandra Horwood returns to the Top 50

Jamie Townsend*15*Lawton Partners Financial Planning Services*Winnipeg, MB*Lawton Partners*Being a financial advisor can sometimes be a thankless task, especially if the markets aren\u2019t cooperating, but it can also be very rewarding. Just ask Winnipeg-based advisor Jamie Townsend, who relishes working on complex business transitions, which often include creating new shareholder agreements that are backstopped by proper insurance coverage, as well as formulating a business plan to help guide the new owners. \u201cIt\u2019s the moment where all the planning comes to fruition,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen we help a business transition from one generation to the next, negotiating the buyout terms and assisting in financing arrangements.\u201d
Nathalie Racine*14*RBC Dominion Securities*Pointe-Claire, QC*The Racine-Marcotte Advisory Group*In Nathalie Racine\u2019s view, being a financial advisor is more than just a job. \u201cWe love what we do,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a job; it\u2019s a lifestyle.\u201d
Elie Nour*13*Manulife Securities*Oakville, ON*Nour Private Wealth Manulife Securities*A fixture on the Top 50 Advisors list since 2014, Elie Nour finds himself among Canada\u2019s elite advisory talent again in 2018.

Now in his 11th year as a financial advisor, Nour has his own ideas about what the job should entail. \u201cToday, clients need and expect more than just a money manager,\u201d he says. \u201cClients are looking for advisors who can provide guidance in areas such as tax and estate planning.\u201d\n                            </div>]
Robert Luft*12*HollisWealth, Industrial Alliance Securities*Vancouver, BC*Luft Financial, HollisWealth, Industrial Alliance Securities*When a business reaches a certain size, it becomes much more difficult to maintain high growth levels. But even though Robert Luft had AUM of close to $250 million in 2016, he still managed to achieve double-digit growth in 2017, bringing his assets under management to just over $294 million. He has his sights set on breaching the $300 million threshold in 2018 and adding 30 new clients to his book. That would bring his client count to 535 \u2013 a significant undertaking, but one where Luft believes his team can still deliver a high level of service.

Lyle Rouleau*9*CIBC Wood Gundy*Edmonton, AB*Rouleau Investment Group*The head of Rouleau Investment Group, Lyle Rouleau is making his fifth consecutive appearance on WPC\u2019s Top 50 Advisors list. He increased his AUM by more than $80 million, or 26%, in 2017, which catapulted him into the top 10 this year. His enviable ranking comes as he celebrates a milestone birthday and plans for another successful year with his advisory team. \u201cI will be turning 50 in January and can see myself still working as an advisor in 10 years,\u201d Rouleau says. \u201cIt may be in a reduced capacity or a reduced number of hours, but we will see where the road takes me.\u201d
Kevin Hegedus*8*HollisWealth, Industrial Alliance Securities*Saskatoon, SK*PWM Private Wealth Counsel*Kevin Hegedus returns to the Top 50 list this year, landing once again in the top 10.

Rob McClelland*7*Assante Capital Management*Thornhill, ON*The McClelland Financial Group*In wealth management, consistency is key. It\u2019s a quality Rob McClelland has displayed throughout his career, which is why he has been able to build a book of business approaching $445 million. The Thornhill, Ontariobased advisor has shown similar qualities when it comes to his five appearances on WPC\u2019s Top 50 Advisors list. Last year he was ranked eighth, and he moves up one spot for 2018.
Faisal Karmali*6*CIBC Wood Gundy*Calgary, AB*Popowich Karmali Advisory Group*Celebrating a decade in the advisory business this year, Faisal Karmali marks the occasion with his first appearance on <em>Wealth Professional Canada\u2019s</em> Top 50 Advisor list. The fact that he\u2019s making his debut in sixth place \u2013 after accumulating assets of $450 million \u2013 is even more impressive. Serving 464 clients, Karmali has shifted his business to a fully discretionary model, which has proven popular with the families he provides financial advice to in Calgary. \u201cClients want to understand the products,\u201d he says, \u201cand they want to know how and why an investment fits into the big picture for them.\u201d
Reg Jackson*5*National Bank Financial*London, ON*JMRD Wealth Management Team*London, Ontario-based advisor Reg Jackson returns to the 2018 Top 50 Advisors list with a place in the top five.

Any advisor who can increase his book of business by 70% over a 12-month period deserves acclaim, and this veteran is no different. \u201cI started 29 years ago and was called a stockbroker,\u201d Short says. \u201cNow we complete full financial plans, and I \xa0operate as a portfolio manager. Clients have higher expectations, and we have more extensive capabilities than we had years ago to meet their needs.\u201d
Brad Moore*3*Raymond James*Calgary, AB*SAGE Connected Investing*With 34 years as a financial advisor under his belt, Brad Moore sets the standard for his team at SAGE Connected Investing.

Coming \xa0into the business after first practicing law, he has built an enviable reputation during his eight years as a financial advisor.

Chad Larson*1*Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management*Calgary, AB*MLD Wealth Management Group*While his industry experience puts Larson into veteran territory, he still finds himself at the younger end of the advisor spectrum. Regardless, he has observed how the role has changed over the years. \u201cClients are more informed, and mediocrity has no chance,\u201d he says. \u201cConversations have changed \u2013 they are about the \u2018why,\u2019 not the \u2018how.\u2019 The conversations are about family, occupation and recreation \u2013 that\u2019s the \u2018why\u2019; the \u2018how\u2019 is that they entrust us to be stewards of their capital.\u201d
